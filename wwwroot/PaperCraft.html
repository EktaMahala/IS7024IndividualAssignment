Paper sculpture being the most difficult to master because it involves drawing, design and complex interlocking pattern making skills. Paper and card stock are the most widely used material in arts and crafts. They lend themselves to a wide range of techniques and can be folded, curved, bent, cut, glued, molded, stitched, or layered. Papermaking by hand is also an important paper craft.
            <p>

            <p>In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the education of children.

        <hr />
        The word "paper" derives from papyrus, the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in Egypt as far back as the third millennium B.C.[4] Indeed, the earliest known example of "paper folding" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern road map.[5] However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers.[5]
        <p>
            The first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D.[6] In much of the West, the term origami is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in Japan.[5] Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi (Chinese paper folding), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and paper planes.

            Papel picado, as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while Chinese paper cutting uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. Wycinanki and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.
